# 🧩 Public API Explorer

## 📌 Description

Public API Explorer is a React.js web application that allows users to explore and interact with various public APIs — all in one place! Whether you're looking to get a random cat fact, see a cute dog picture, or discover something new, this app will let you try out different public APIs quickly and easily.

## 🚧 Project Status

Current Status: In development - basic structure complete with 2 APIs integrated.

The foundation of the app has been laid, and two public APIs have been successfully integrated. More APIs will be added soon. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🌐 Live Demo

The app is published on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://93metra.github.io/public-api-explorer/). However, please note that the public APIs may not always respond well when the app is opened through GitHub Pages. For a better experience, it is recommended to run the project locally.

## 💡 Features (Coming Soon)

- 🔄 Interact with fun and useful public APIs (e.g., random cat facts, dog images, jokes, etc.)
- 💻 See the actual API endpoint and sample code used for each request
- 🧪 Test APIs directly in the browser
- 📘 Learn how to use APIs in your own projects

## 🛠️ Built With 

- React.js – Frontend library for building the user interface
- [Fetch API / Axios] – For making API requests

## 📌 Goals

This project is meant to be educational and fun — a great way to:

- Discover interesting public APIs
- Learn how to make API calls in React
- See practical examples of how to use APIs

## 💻 Running the Project Locally
