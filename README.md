## 📌 Description

Whether you're looking to get a random cat fact, see a cute dog picture, or discover something new, this app will let you try out different public APIs quickly and easily

## 🚧 Project Status

Current Status: **Migrated to Next.js ✅.**

- The project has been successfully migrated from React.js to Next.js .
- Three APIs are already integrated and functional.
- Future updates will include:
    - A user interface for adding custom APIs.
    - Local storage integration to save user-added APIs for persistence.
    - Additional APIs and improved UI/UX.

## 🌐 Live Demo

The *original React version* was published on GitHub Pages [here](https://93metra.github.io/public-api-explorer/).

**Please note this link points to the pre-migration version.** A new **Vercel deployment link** will be provided after the Next.js migration is complete. For the latest version and best experience, running the project locally is recommended.
